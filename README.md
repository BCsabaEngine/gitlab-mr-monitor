# Gitlab MR monitor

Gitlab MergeRequest monitor, online access: https://bcsabaengine.github.io/gitlab-mr-monitor/

Switch to a higher gear in the management of MRs! Is it a problem for you that you don't notice or don't get informed about an MR? Or are you overloaded and unable to deal with several MRs at the same time? He used the MR monitor, which efficiently collects the affected MRs for you. You will clearly see the progress of development processes.

## The most important functions

### Me as author

The simplest feature that shows the MRs you have created. You can see which colleagues undertook the review, what state the pipeline is in, and when the MR will be able to be merged.

### Me as reviewer

Whatever you have undertaken, whether or not you have been assigned the MR review, you can see which MRs you need to review and comment on. If you received a notification about it yesterday, but you didn't have time for it, you won't forget to do it.

### Custom projects

You can create one or more scopes to connect to different projects. If you are involved in several projects, add them to a scope and you can see the tasks grouped. Even if you have something to do with it or are just curious about the progress.

## Configuration

In addition to the author and review scopes, you can add several unique scopes for which you can set:

- Gitlab group (including all projects)
- Project whose MRs you are interested in
- Users whose MRs you are interested in
- Show/hide drafts
- Warning sound/mute
- Hide mergeable MRs (when your task is over)

### Hideable MRs

Despite all the precise settings, you may encounter an MR that is not your field. You can hide them so that they do not interfere with the work that is really yours.

## Automatically updated PWA application

The monitor is a web application that you can use in a browser, but you can also install it on MacOS, Windows or Linux operating systems. The installed version is checked at startup and updated to the latest version if necessary. It does not use anything other than the browser and the Gitlab server, and does not send any sensitive data or source code to external websites. If you don't believe me, look at the source code, it's open source!
